We all know how annoying it is to setup a new documentation project. That is why this was created to help you get started quickly with [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) & [UI Thing](https://ui-thing.behonbaker.com/getting-started/introduction). UI Thing is just a set of Nuxt components that were styled to look like the ones from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Modules

There are several modules at play in this project:

- [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/)
