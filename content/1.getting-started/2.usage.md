If you already know how [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) works, you can skip this section. Just clone the repository and start writing your documentation.

## Clone the repository

You can use a package like [giget](https://unjs.io/packages/giget) to clone the repository

```bash [Terminal]
npx --yes giget@latest https://github.com/BayBreezy/ui-doc-starter --install
```

After that just start the development server

```bash [Terminal]
npm run dev
```

## Docker

If you are a fan of Docker you can customize the `Dockerfile` and `compose.yml` to your liking.

```dockerfile [Dockerfile]
FROM node:20.0-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

ENV SITE_URL=http://localhost:3030

RUN npm run build
```
